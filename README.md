## ðŸ’§ Tech Stack

* Python (pandas, subprocess)
* Flask (optional for frontend routing)
* Bootstrap (CDN-based styling)
* CSV for I/O

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **User selects a company** from dropdown in `index.html`
2. **Company name is injected** into `raw_leads.csv`
3. **`main.py` triggers**:

   * `verifier.py` (email validation)
   * `enrich_leads.py` (industry, size, role detection)
   * `ranker.py` (lead scoring and CSV output)
4. **Results** are displayed from `final.csv` on `company.html`

---

## ðŸ“† Setup & Run

### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

## ðŸ“„ Deliverables
